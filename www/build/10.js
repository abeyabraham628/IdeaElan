No employee will be retaliated against for making a complaint in good faith regarding a \n             violation of these policies, or for participating in good faith in an investigation pursuant to these policies.\n             If an employee feels he/she has been retaliated against, the employee should file a complaint using the \n             procedures set forth above.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Open Door Policy</h5>\n         <p>\n             The company has an open door policy and takes employee concerns and problems seriously. The company values \n             each employee and strives to provide a positive work experience. Employees are encouraged to bring any workplace\n             concerns or problems they might have or know about to their supervisor or some other member of management.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Privacy</h5>\n         <p>\n             Employees and employers share a relationship based on trust and mutual respect. However, the company retains \n             the right to access all company property including computers, desks, file cabinets, storage facilities, and \n             files and folders, electronic or otherwise, at any time. Employees should not entertain any expectations of \n             privacy when on company grounds or while using company property.\n             <br/><br/>\n             All documents, files, voice-mails and electronic information, including e-mails and other communications, \n             created, received or maintained on or through company property are the property of the company, not the \n             employee. Therefore employees should have no expectation of privacy over those files or documents.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Personnel Files</h5>\n         <p>\n             The company maintains a personnel file on each employee. These files are kept confidential to the extent \n             possible. Employees may review their personnel file upon request.\n             <br/><br/>\n             It is important that personnel files accurately reflect each employee’s personal information. \n             Employees are expected to inform the company of any change in name, address, home phone number, \n             and home address, and marital status, number of dependents or emergency contact information.\n         </p>\n  \n         <h5>Tardiness</h5>\n         <p>\n             Employees are expected to arrive on time and ready for work. An employee who arrives 15 minutes after \n             their scheduled arrival time is considered tardy. The company recognizes that situations arise which\n             hinder punctuality; regardless, excessive tardiness is prohibited, and may be subject to disciplinary action.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Leave Policy</h5>\n         <h6>Earned Leave</h6>\n         <p>\n             All regular, full -time employees at Idea Elan are eligible for earned leave. Earned leave is calculated on a \n             month on month basis for the calendar year (January-December). If you have joined during the middle of the year, \n             your earned leave will be pro-rated from the date you started employment through Dec 31st of that calendar year\n             <br/><br/>\n             Every month Earned Leave accrues at 8 hours per month (equivalent to 1.5 days per month per calendar year).\n             <br/><br/>\n             During the probation period of 3 months , you are not entitled to take Earned Leave You may avail your Earned \n             leaves only after completing your probation period, at which point you will have accrued 40 (8 hours X 3) \n             hours or 3 days.\n             <br/><br/>\n             Earned Leave is exclusive of official and weekly holidays. Hence if an employee takes leave during which time a\n             declared holiday or weekend occurs, then those particular date(s) will not be counted as your Earned Leave.\n             <br/><br/>\n             If the employee does not utilize the leave then he/she will be provided a cash equivalent compensation for \n             those days.\n             <br/><br/>\n             Earned leave can be encashed along with the bonus (March).\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Comp Offs</h5>\n         <p>\n             Sometimes it is necessary to work extra time to meet the deadlines. We may require certain employees to put \n             extra effort \n             and time to meet the schedules.After the project work is done, this extra time spent by these individuals \n             may be given a compensatory-off on some \n             other day(s) and/or we will provide 50% of the salary for the comp off day.\n             <br/><br/>\n             Comp offs can be given only on the days with prior email approval from the reporting manager. Leaves without \n             approval cannot be considered as comp offs.\n             <br/><br/>\n             Note: Minimum of 7 hours on a holiday will be considered as one compensatory off & a minimum of 4 hours on \n             a holiday or overtime as a half - day compensatory off.\n             <br/><br/>\n             For Example: If an employee works for 2 Saturdays in a month then they will be given 1 day extra salary and\n              may also receive 2 extra comp days at a later date based on deadlines and approvals from managers.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Accumulation/ Carry forward</h5>\n         <p>\n             You are urged to use your Earned Leave time in the year it has accrued.\n             <br/><br/>  \n             However, if you are unable to use all of your accrued Earned Leave during a calendar year, you may elect to\n             carry forward any accrued but unused vacation time into the next calendar year, subject to the maximum accrual\n             level of 80 hours (2 weeks) .Hence you can accumulate/ carry forward your earned leaves up to a maximum of\n             10 days.\n         </p>\n \n         <h5>Holidays</h5>\n         <p>\n             Company will observe a list of holidays not exceeding 12 each year as per the Gazette Holiday Calendar. \n             The dates of the holidays shall be made available to the employees on the 1st of January every year. \n             There may be a list of Optional Holidays shared along with this list.
